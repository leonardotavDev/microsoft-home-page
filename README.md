  <p style="font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0.5px">
      The aim of this project was to recreate the home page of Microsoft's
      website with a simple and didactic approach, using the fundamental
      technologies of web development:
      <strong>HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript.</strong> The main focus was
      on using HTML to structure the content, CSS to style the page and
      Bootstrap to ensure a responsive and functional layout. The intention was
      to reproduce the basic structure of Microsoft's layout, such as
      navigation, featured content and the footer, while taking advantage of the
      agility provided by the use of Bootstrap, which facilitates the creation
      of a modern, responsive design.

  <div style="display: flex; flex-flow: column; gap: 12px">
      <li style="letter-spacing: 0.5px">
        <strong>HTML:</strong> To structure the content of the page, including
        the header, navigation, sections and footer. The use of HTML was key to
        creating a solid, semantic basis for the page's content.
      </li>
      <li style="letter-spacing: 0.5px">
        <strong>CSS:</strong> To style the page, creating responsive layouts and
        attractive visuals, such as color control, typography and the
        arrangement of elements. CSS was used in conjunction with Bootstrap to
        customize the design and ensure that the layout was visually pleasing on
        different devices.
      </li>
      <li style="letter-spacing: 0.5px">
        <strong>BOOTSTRAP:</strong> It is used to speed up the development
        process, providing a series of ready-made components and classes that
        guarantee a responsive and visually pleasing structure. Bootstrap was
        used mainly to facilitate the creation of responsive navigation, grid
        and buttons, allowing the design to adjust automatically to different
        screen sizes.
      </li>
      <li style="letter-spacing: 0.5px">
        <strong>JAVASCRIPT:</strong> To add interactivity, such as simple
        animations or dynamic functionalities (for example, a search bar that
        displays suggestions as you type). Although the main focus has been on
        HTML, CSS and Bootstrap, JavaScript has helped to enhance the user
        experience with dynamic features.
